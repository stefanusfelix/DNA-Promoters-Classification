# DNA-Promoters-Classification

In my project, I aim to classify DNA sequences into promoter and non-promoter regions using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. DNA promoters are crucial for gene expression regulation, and accurately identifying them is vital for understanding biological processes. First, I preprocess the DNA sequences to extract relevant features such as nucleotide composition, sequence length, and structural properties. Then, I use these features to train an SVM classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm capable of handling high-dimensional data. By optimizing the SVM parameters and employing techniques like cross-validation, I aim to build a robust classifier capable of accurately distinguishing between promoter and non-promoter regions in DNA sequences. This project has implications in bioinformatics, genomics, and pharmaceutical research, providing insights into gene regulation mechanisms and potential drug target identification.
